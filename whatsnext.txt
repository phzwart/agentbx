# agentbx Development Log: What's Next

## Summary of Recent Work

- **Refactored the codebase** to clearly separate agent logic (`src/agentbx/core/agents/`) and client/optimizer logic (`src/agentbx/core/clients/`).
- Implemented an **abstract optimization client** system, with subclasses for coordinate, B-factor, and solvent parameter optimization.
- Ensured all optimizers use a single source of truth for parameter updates, and follow PyTorch conventions (separating backward/step logic).
- Updated all imports and examples to use the new structure.
- Fixed syntax and import errors, ensuring the codebase is ready for modular, scalable development.

## Current State

- The codebase is organized and modular, with clear boundaries between agents (services that listen to Redis streams and process requests) and clients (optimizers that submit requests and update bundles).
- Example scripts are in place to demonstrate usage of the optimizers and agents.
- The system is ready for real-world, multi-process/multi-shell testing.

## Next Steps

1. **Prepare a Test Case:**
   - Select a real protein structure (PDB file) and intentionally mess up the coordinates (e.g., add random noise or distortions).
   - Store this as a new macromolecule bundle in Redis using the provided example scripts.

2. **Multi-Shell/Process Testing:**
   - Open at least two separate shells:
     - **Shell 1:** Start the async geometry agent (from `src/agentbx/core/agents/async_geometry_agent.py` or via the example script).
     - **Shell 2:** Run a client optimizer (e.g., coordinate, B-factor, or solvent optimizer) to submit optimization requests and monitor progress.
   - Ensure the agent and client communicate via Redis streams as intended.

3. **Monitor and Debug:**
   - Observe logs in both shells for errors, warnings, and progress.
   - Check that bundles are updated in Redis and that optimization proceeds as expected.
   - Validate that the optimizer can correct the messed-up coordinates and improve the structure.

4. **Iterate and Document:**
   - Note any issues, bottlenecks, or unexpected behaviors.
   - Append findings, fixes, and ideas to this `whatsnext.txt` file as a running development blog.

## Goals for the Next Session

- Achieve a successful round-trip: agent and client running in separate shells, optimizing a real (messed-up) protein structure.
- Confirm that the modular agent/client architecture is robust in a real-world, multi-process environment.
- Document results, issues, and next ideas in this file for future reference.

## Development Session: Clean Data Loading Infrastructure

**Date:** Current session

### What Was Accomplished

1. **Created Clean Data Loading Infrastructure** (`src/agentbx/utils/data_loader.py`):
   - Unified `DataLoader` class that consolidates existing functionality
   - Simple functions to load macromolecule data from PDB files
   - Simple functions to load experimental data from MTZ files
   - Data compatibility validation between macromolecule and experimental data
   - Bundle information retrieval and cleanup utilities
   - Convenience functions for simple usage patterns

2. **Key Features:**
   - `load_macromolecule(pdb_file)` → returns bundle ID
   - `load_experimental_data(mtz_file)` → returns bundle ID  
   - `load_both_data(pdb_file, mtz_file)` → returns (macro_id, exp_id)
   - `validate_data_compatibility(macro_id, exp_id)` → validation results
   - `get_bundle_info(bundle_id)` → comprehensive bundle information
   - `cleanup_bundles(bundle_ids)` → delete bundles from Redis

3. **Created Example Script** (`examples/data_loading_example.py`):
   - Demonstrates all loading methods
   - Shows data compatibility validation
   - Illustrates bundle information retrieval
   - Provides working examples for the next steps

### Current State

- **Clean infrastructure is ready** for reading macromolecule and MTZ data into Redis
- **No duplication** - reuses existing processors and utilities
- **Simple API** - just call functions and get bundle IDs back
- **Validation included** - checks data compatibility automatically
- **Example available** - ready for testing with real data

### Next Steps

1. **Test the Infrastructure:**
   ```bash
   # Download test data
   python examples/download_pdb_data.py 1ubq
   
   # Test the new data loading infrastructure
   python examples/data_loading_example.py
   ```

2. **Multi-Shell Testing:**
   - Use the new data loading functions to create bundles
   - Start geometry agent in one shell
   - Run optimization clients in another shell
   - Verify end-to-end workflow works

3. **Integration Testing:**
   - Load real (messed-up) protein structure
   - Validate data compatibility
   - Run optimization and verify results

### Goals for Next Session

- Achieve successful round-trip using the new clean infrastructure
- Confirm that data loading → agent → client workflow is robust
- Document any issues or improvements needed
