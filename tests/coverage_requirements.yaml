# Coverage requirements for AgentBX test suite
# This file defines the minimum coverage percentage required for each file

# Core functionality - high coverage requirements
core:
  src/agentbx/core/base_client.py: 100    # Core client should be fully tested
  src/agentbx/core/redis_manager.py: 95   # High coverage for Redis functionality

# Schema generation - complex code, lower requirements
schemas:
  src/agentbx/schemas/generator.py: 80    # Complex generator, hard to test everything

# Main entry points
main:
  src/agentbx/__main__.py: 100            # Main entry point should be fully tested

# Overall project requirements
project:
  overall_minimum: 85                      # Minimum overall coverage for the project
  strict_mode: false                       # Whether to fail on any file below requirement

# Optional: exclude files from coverage requirements
exclude:
  - src/agentbx/__init__.py               # Simple init files
  - "*/__pycache__/*"                     # Python cache files
  - "*/tests/*"                           # Test files themselves
